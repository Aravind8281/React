React Strict Mode is a development mode feature in React that helps identify common mistakes and potential issues in your application. It performs additional checks and warnings to help you write better code and prepare for the future React updates.

When you enable Strict Mode in a React application, it does the following:

1. **Identifying Side Effects:**
   Strict Mode helps detect unexpected side effects during rendering by double-invoking functions. This helps in identifying components that have unintended side effects or dependencies on external resources.

2. **Detecting Legacy Lifecycles:**
   Strict Mode provides warnings if you are using legacy lifecycle methods. In modern React versions, some lifecycle methods have been deprecated, and Strict Mode helps you identify and update your code accordingly.

3. **Highlighting Unsafe Lifecycles:**
   It warns about unsafe lifecycles, which are those that might cause performance issues or are likely to be deprecated in future React releases. This encourages developers to update their code to use safer alternatives.

4. **Warning about Deprecated FindDOMNode:**
   It issues a warning if you are using the `findDOMNode` method, which is considered unsafe. This is because it relies on direct DOM manipulation, which goes against React's declarative approach.

To enable Strict Mode, you can wrap your entire application or specific components with the `<React.StrictMode>` component. Typically, this is done in the `index.js` file where your main `ReactDOM.render` call is located.

Here's an example of how to enable Strict Mode:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

After enabling Strict Mode, you might see additional warnings or error messages in the console during development. These messages are meant to guide you in writing more robust and maintainable React code. It's important to note that these warnings are only present in development mode and are stripped out in the production build for performance reasons.

Using React Strict Mode is a good practice, especially during development, to catch potential issues early and ensure your application is built with best practices in mind.
